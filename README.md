# DEW: Decentralized Election Watch
#### [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/Gqtz2I8H-YY)

Do you love *Electoral Authoritarianism*? Of course you do! You live in a country where the *hybrid regime* does so.
However, here you can elect your skipper with fair voting system - Free (Free as in Freedom), and Transparent (No lies!)
The site uses **Tideman** algorithm to choose between candidates. The philosophy is that: there will be no nominees, everyone can stand out. When someone wishes to be a leader, he actually pleads to take on the power, and upon given you cannot put him down if he's duely wrong. In this case, there will be none wishing to get on the throne, you better know among you who's the best.

First, create a voting event, in events page. Choose your preferred three candidates among you. Submit. The results are published in results section after 24 hours [wait till all has cast their votes].

This is a simple personal project I authored in my spare time, with humbling simplicity looks, yet bustier codeblocks in heart. Consider doing PR, I'd be grateful.
